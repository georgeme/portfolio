        <h3><i class="fab fa-canadian-maple-leaf"></i>Where do I call home?</h3>
        <p>I've lived in the Seattle area since 1992. Prior to moving to the area, I lived in a suburb of Detroit, Michigan. I much prefer the winters in Seattle and overall the whole vibe here suits me much better. Fall is my favorite time of year I've been fortunate enough to live in places that have beautiful autumns.</p>
